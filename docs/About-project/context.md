# Context and Main Goals

## The context and specifications of the project

- Nowadays, many companies face ongoing challenges in managing schedules and allocating employees. The lack of proper tools to efficiently organize shifts and work schedules can lead to issues such as task overload, communication failures, and disorganization, directly impacting productivity and employee well-being.

- To address these challenges, our goal is to develop **SmartAsk**, an integrated schedule management system for employees. This system aims to optimize the distribution of workers, ensuring that task allocation is done in a balanced and efficient way, based on specific rules and algorithms.

- **SmartAsk** allows for the efficient distribution of workers across different work locations, respecting predefined rules and using intelligent algorithms to ensure fair allocation. Additionally, the system ensures that schedules are separated by weeks throughout the month, optimizing organization and operational efficiency.

## Goals of the project

1. **Optimize Schedule Management**: Create an automated system to efficiently distribute shifts.
2. **Ensure Balance in Schedules**: Ensure fair allocation and avoid overloading employees.
3. **Improve Operational Efficiency**: Optimize the use of human resources.
4. **Ease of Use**: Develop a simple interface for quick and error-free management.
5. **Continuous Analysis and Improvement**: Collect data to adjust and enhance the system over time.

>With these goals, **SmartAsk** aims not only to improve schedule management but also to provide a better experience for employees and the company, ensuring a more efficient and balanced operation.
