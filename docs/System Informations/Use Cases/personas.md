# Personas

In the system is important to understand the different types of users that will interact with it. In this way, we have defined two personas that represent the main users of the system:

- Luís, a 37 year-old **Administrator**.
- Catarina, a 45 year-old **Team Manager**.

## Luís

Luís, a 37 year-old company employee, is responsible for **administering** the system distributed by its own company.

Since his company is expanding services, a new system has been developed to **automate** the **scheduling** of employees. Consequently, Luís now **oversees** the management of this new service. More specifically, he is responsible, when necessary, to **add** or **remove** algorithms to generate schedules into the system.

He needs a tool that allows him to **manage** the **algorithms** that are available in the system, as well as to **monitor** the **performance** of each one, so it is also important for him to have access to the **results** of the **schedules** generated by the system and to **compare** different algorithms, to test them and understand which are  worthy of being kept in the system.

## Catarina

![Catarina](@site/static/img/CatarinaPersona.png)

Catarina is a 45 year-old employee, who is also a **Team Manager** inside her company. Because of this, she is responsible for **creating** and **assigning** the necessary schedules to her colleagues.

With the development of her company, there has been a **significant** raise in the number of employees working. Due to this, it has become impossible to assign these schedules **by-hand**.

She needs a tool that helps her generate schedules for all her peers in the fastest and most equal way possible. She also needs a system that allows her to **edit** different teams and **add** or **remove** restrictions to the schedules, as well as to **visualize** the **progress** of the schedule generation process, in order to keep track of the workload distribution.
