# User Stories

## User Stories of the project

### Administrator User Stories

As an **administrator**, I want to add new algorithms, developed in Python, to the system, so that I can optimize the schedule generation process.

As an **administrator**, I want to remove outdated algorithms that are no longer suitable for the system so that I can keep the system up to date.

### Manager User Stories

As a **manager**, I want to be able to visualize past generated schedules, so that I can keep track of how the workload has been distributed along the time.

As a **manager**, I want to add a new restriction to a given employee when he informs me that he is, for example, taking the day off, so that I can generate a new schedule that takes this into account.

As a **manager**, I want to be able to see the progress of a schedule being generated, so that I can maintain control over the process.

As a **manager**, I want to create a new work team, composed by a set of employees, so that I can generate a schedule for this team.

As a **manager**, I want to edit an existing team by adding/removing new employees, so that I can keep the team updated considering the evolution of the company.

As a **manager**, I want to compare two solutions that were given, for the same problem, by different algorithms, so that I can comprehend what is the better option.


**Note**: As it is possible to understand by visualizing the **Use Case Model**, the administrator has also access to the functionalities that are available to the manager.
